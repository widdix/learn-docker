## Goal

Ensure that Docker is working on your machine.

## Instructions

It's time to start your first Docker container to see if your Docker setup is complete. Run the following command:

```
docker run hello-world
```

If you get output like this:

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
